    "This notebook is meant to serve as a small example project of how to get data from the web using Python. Here we will scrape the data from the web, parse the results using regular expressions, and visualize the data. This small project could probably be done a lot more efficiently by hand, but the ideas here are powerful and can be extended to much larger applications. There are many tools that a data scientist will need to use, and web scraping, regular expressions, and visualization are all good techniques to practice! "
